DESCRIPTION

Seta is a Gnome/Gtk application which aims to be a replacement for file
manager and terminal emulator. Inspired by Dolphin and GNU Midnight
Commander, it uses a two panel UI. Each panel can contain both file
manager and terminal widgets. The working directories for the two
widgets are (basically) kept synchronized.

Seta is mainly written in D language (http://www.digitalmars.com/d/)
using the GtkD library (http://dsource.org/projects/gtkd/).

Seta is licensed under the FSF General Public License version 3.




FEATURES

1. synchronization of working directories

When you double-click a directory in filer, "cd <path to the directory>"
will be sent to the associated terminal. Similarly, when you type
"cd <path to somewhere>" in the command line, Seta will extract the
path from terminal's text and the associated filer starts to show that
directory's contents. Note that this synchronization can easily get
out when, for example, you use alias commands to change directory or
some complicated commands. If this functionality does not work in your
system, it can be related to the form of your prompt. In that case
setting "PROMPT" variable as what appears in the prompt will fix the
problem. For example, if your prompt looks like
"foo@bar:~$ "
then, in the preference dialog, setting "PROMPT" as "foo@bar" will fix
the problem.


2. command line support to refer to directories

In terminal widgets, you can easily input fullpaths to the working
directories by using keyboard shortcuts (default key-bindings are
"Ctrl-<" and "Ctrl->" for left and right panels, respectively).
Also, when Enter or Tab is pressed in the terminal widget,
"$L1DIR", "$L2DIR", ... will be expanded by fullpath of the working
directory of the n-th tab in the left pane. "$LDIR" is replaced by
the working directory shown in the left pane. The same holds for
"$R1DIR", "$R2DIR", ... and "$RDIR".


3. drag and drop in the filer

You can move files by dragging them with left mouse button. With
middle button (usually scroll wheel) you can copy files.


4. nautilus scripts





5. SSH/SFTP

You can connect to a remote servers via SSH and Gvfs within Seta.
The Gvfs library can mount remote file systems in the local file tree
(under "~/.gvfs/"). When the mount operation is successfully connected,
"ssh <options> <user>@<host>" will be sent to the terminal widget, and
the password asked during the mount operation will be automatically
inputted.




PREREQUISITE LIBS TO RUN THIS SOFTWARE

1. libgtk+-2.0, libglib2.0, libgio2.0 : Gnome libraries, already installed in most of linux systems
2. libvte9                            : usually come with Gnome libraries




PREREQUISITE LIBS TO COMPILE FROM SOURCE

(Too much dependencies! This should be fixed.)

1. libgtk+-2.0, libglib2.0, libgio2.0 : Gnome libraries, usually already installed
2. libvte-dev (> 0.20)                : library for terminal emulator widget, deb or rpm package should be available
3. tango                              : D library, compile from source, deb or rpm package may be available
4. GtkD (> 1.3)                       : D binding for Gnome libs, compile from source




COMPILE & INSTALL

Before compiling D source code, compile tiny C code in "src/C" by
$ make
in "src/C".

To compile this software (and required D libraries) it is highly
recommended that you use dsss.
With dsss, to build the software just type
$ dsss build
in the Seta's root or "src" directory.

Without dsss, edit $(INCLUDE), $(LIBPATH) and name of the libraries
(listed above) in src/Makefile and type
$ make
in "src" directory.

To install this software, 
$ sudo make install
in "src" directory.
